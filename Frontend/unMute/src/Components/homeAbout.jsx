            <p className="text-black text-xl mt-10">unMute is a space built for men to break the silence. Too often, guys are told to “man up” and keep their struggles hidden, but the reality is—we all face challenges. unMute exists to change that. It’s a platform where men can open up about mental health, relationships, identity, and the everyday pressures of life without judgment. By sharing real stories and resources, we aim to inspire honest conversations and remind men that vulnerability is strength, not weakness.</p>

            <p className="text-black text-xl mt-10">Our mission is simple: to give men a voice. Whether you’re here to read, listen, or share your own journey, unMute provides a supportive community that pushes back against stigma.</p>
